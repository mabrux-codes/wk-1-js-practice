Challenge Descriptions
1. Student Grade Generator
This function prompts the user to enter student marks (0-100).
Based on the input, it returns a grade:
A for marks above 79
B for 60-79
C for 49-59
D for 40-49
E for marks below 40
2. Speed Detector
Takes the speed of a car as input.
If the speed is less than 70, it prints "Ok".
For every 5 km/s above 70, it adds 1 demerit point.
If the demerit points exceed 12, it prints "License suspended".
3. Net Salary Calculator
Takes basic salary and benefits as input.
Calculates:
Gross Salary (Basic Salary + Benefits)
PAYE Tax
NHIF Deduction
NSSF Deduction
Net Salary (Gross Salary - Total Deductions)
